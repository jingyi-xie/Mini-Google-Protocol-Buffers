Task: get class name, field name and field type of one class with one field
Estimated Time: 2h
Target Deadline: 5pm, Jan 30

Actual Delivery: 12:03pm, Jan 30
Commit ID: 860861daf2b7d9116d0dff3df151d193dd8e11a0
Comments: The old task was to “implement and test an end-to-end solution that
supports getClassNames,getSourceCode and createAllClasses (one class with one
field)”. This took longer than expected because I needed to figure out how to
store the read data and I had some problems when trying to print out the data.
So I broke down this task into two.
