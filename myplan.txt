Comments: The old task was to “implement and test an end-to-end solution that
supports getClassNames,getSourceCode and createAllClasses (one class with one
field)”. This took longer than expected because I needed to figure out how to
store the read data and I had some problems when trying to print out the data.
So I broke down this task into two.
